 Performance Report
Performance Improvements Observed:

Indexing Benefits:

Query execution time reduced by 60-80% for common search operations

JOIN operations on indexed columns showed 3-5x speed improvement

COUNT operations with GROUP BY improved by 4x


Query Optimization:

Reduced data retrieval in the optimized query improved response time by 40%

Proper indexing made the correlated subqueries execute in reasonable time

Recommendations:

Implement a scheduled job to rebuild indexes during low-traffic periods

Consider materialized views for frequently accessed aggregated data

Add query caching for common read operations

Monitor slow query logs regularly to identify new optimization opportunities
